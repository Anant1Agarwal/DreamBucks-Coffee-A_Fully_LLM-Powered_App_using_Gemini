We want the backend system Such that we can store images. A bucket based system Where you can upload images and files, and retrieve them easily

We also want a database system where we can upload product data in the form of JSON and retrieve it easily.

Firebase is a good option for this. We can use Firebase storage for storing images and files and Firebase Firestore/RealTime Database for storing JSON data.

firebase databse is a NoSQL database. It is a document-oriented database. It stores data in the form of JSON. It is a cloud-hosted database. It is a real-time database. It is a scalable database. It is a serverless

In Firebase, we need RealTime Database and Storage. 

Generate Service Account Key 
No way of uploading/push Service Account Key credentials to server securely, so we use .env file to store the credentials by copying the credentials from the Service Account Key.json file


Firebase storage is not free, so only 1 gb of data can be stored for free.
